# woocommerce-paid-product-pages
This plugin will hide the product description until payment made. 
After which the product purchase options are removed, and user will have access to product page content

## Activation of product
Navigate to product attributes and create an attribute called "Purchase"
I recommend setting "Visible on the product page" to False
